# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Version Control

Always prefer the `gh` CLI over raw `git` for GitHub operations (pushing branches, creating/updating PRs, issues, API calls) — it authenticates and works more reliably in this environment. Use plain `git` only for local operations `gh` doesn't cover (staging, committing, branching, diffs).

`origin` (`sbahamon/open-advocacy`) is a fork. **Always open pull requests against `sbahamon:main` (the fork's own main), not the upstream `StrongTownsChicago/open-advocacy`.** Pass `--repo sbahamon/open-advocacy --base main` so `gh` doesn't default the base to the upstream repo.

## Project Overview

Open Advocacy is a civic engagement platform for tracking legislative advocacy projects and representatives. It consists of a FastAPI backend, React/TypeScript frontend, and a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, deployed on Railway.

### Docker (full stack)

```bash
docker-compose up         # Start postgres + backend + frontend
docker-compose up --build # Start and rebuild
```

## Architecture

### Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Python 3.12) — note: no Alembic migrations; tables are created via `init_db` at startup
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Material UI + Leaflet maps + react-markdown
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/PostGIS in production, SQLite in development
- **Deployment**: Railway

### Backend Structure

The backend follows a layered architecture:

```
API Routes (app/api/routes/) → Service Layer (app/services/) → DB Providers (app/db/) → ORM Models (app/models/orm/)
```

- **`app/main.py`** — FastAPI app with CORS and logging middleware; triggers `initialize_application()` on startup (see Auto-Initialization below)
- **`app/core/config.py`** — All configuration via env vars (DATABASE_PROVIDER, DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET_KEY, OPENSTATES_API_KEY, etc.)
- **`app/core/auth.py`** — JWT auth, OAuth2, password hashing
- **`app/db/`** — Abstract `DatabaseProvider` interface; `SQLProvider` supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- **`app/geo/`** — Geographic lookup layer: abstract `GeoProvider` interface with `PostgresGeoProvider` (PostGIS) and `SQLiteGeoProvider` (Shapely) implementations, plus `geocoding_service.py` and `provider_factory.py`. Used by `EntityService` for address-to-district resolution.
- **`app/services/`** — Business logic; `service_factory.py` provides three tiers of DI: plain `create_*()` factories, FastAPI `Depends()`-compatible `get_*()` functions, and `@lru_cache` singletons (`get_cached_*()`) for script use; `scorecard_refresh_service.py` provides `run_scorecard_refresh()` for the admin refresh endpoint
- **`app/api/routes/admin/scorecard.py`** — `POST /api/admin/scorecard/refresh` — super-admin-only endpoint that fetches live eLMS data and upserts EntityStatusRecords for all scorecard projects
- **`app/imports/`** — Modular data import system: `locations/` configs, `sources/` data fetchers, `importers/` processors, `orchestrator.py` coordinator
- **`app/scripts/`** — Older utility scripts (`seed_dummy_data.py`, `db_diagnostic.py`, `import_chicago_ward_geojson.py`, etc.)

### Auto-Initialization on Startup

On first startup, `app/main.py` calls `scripts/initialize_app.py:initialize_application()`, which:

1. Creates DB tables
2. Seeds location data based on `SEED_LOCATIONS` env var (e.g. `chicago`, `illinois`)
3. Seeds project data based on `SEED_PROJECTS` env var (e.g. `adu`, `example`, `scorecard`)

Initialization is guarded by a database-state check: `scripts/init_db.py:tables_exist()` queries whether the `groups` table already exists using SQLAlchemy's `inspect` API (works for both SQLite and PostgreSQL). If the table exists, initialization is skipped entirely and no data is modified. This replaces a previous `/tmp` file-based lock that was ephemeral and caused data loss on Railway redeployments.

To force a clean reset in development, run `python -m scripts.init_db --drop` (drops and recreates all tables) then restart the app. For PostgreSQL, you can also run `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;` then restart.

### Frontend Structure

- **`src/services/api.ts`** — Axios client; base URL from `VITE_API_URL` or falls back to `/api` (relative); forces HTTPS on all requests
- **`src/services/imports.ts`** — API service for data import operations (admin only)
- **`src/services/scorecard.ts`** — API service for the scorecard endpoint and `scorecardService.refreshScorecardData()` for the admin refresh action
- **`src/contexts/`** — `AuthContext` (JWT auth state), `UserRepresentativesContext` (user's reps)
- **`src/pages/`** — Route-level components; `admin/` for admin pages (AdminDashboard, UserManagement, DataImportPage, RegisterPage); `ProjectDashboard` for generic slug-based dashboards; `Scorecard` for the multi-issue alderperson scorecard at `/scorecard`
- **`src/components/`** — Shared UI components organized by domain (`Entity/`, `Project/`, `Status/`, `auth/`, `common/`)
- **`src/utils/config.ts`** — App name/description branding from `VITE_APPLICATION_NAME` / `VITE_APPLICATION_DESCRIPTION`

### Data Model

Core entities with UUID primary keys:

- **Group** — Organizes users and projects; each project and user belongs to a group
- **Project** — Advocacy initiatives with `status` + `preferred_status` (EntityStatus enum), linked to a `Jurisdiction` and `Group`; optional `slug` (unique URL key) and `dashboard_config` (JSON with `representative_title` and `status_labels` for dashboard views)
- **Entity** — Representatives/officials with contact info and `entity_type`
- **EntityStatusRecord** — Links entities to projects with position data (EntityStatus: `solid_approval`, `leaning_approval`, `neutral`, `leaning_disapproval`, `solid_disapproval`, `unknown`)
- **Jurisdiction** / **District** — Legislative bodies and geographic areas (GeoJSON boundaries)
- **User** — Role-based: `super_admin`, `group_admin`, `editor`, `viewer`

### Environment Variables

Key variables (set in `.env` for local dev, Railway for production):

- `DATABASE_PROVIDER` — `sqlite` (default) or `postgres`
- `DATABASE_URL` — Connection string
- `ENVIRONMENT` — `development` or `production`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` — CORS origin; defaults to both `localhost:3000` and `localhost:5173`
- `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` — JWT signing secret (required for auth to work)
- `OPENSTATES_API_KEY` — For state legislature data imports (required for Illinois import)
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` — Default admin username in dev (default: `admin`)
- `GEOCODING_SERVICE` — Optional geocoding provider (`google`, `mapbox`, etc.)
- `GEOCODING_API_KEY` — API key for geocoding provider
- `DATA_DIR` — Override the data directory path
- `SEED_LOCATIONS` — Comma-separated location keys to seed on cold start (e.g. `chicago`, `chicago,illinois`; default: empty)
- `SEED_PROJECTS` — Comma-separated project keys to seed on cold start (e.g. `adu`, `adu,example`, `scorecard`; default: empty)
- `CHICAGO_CITYSCAPE_API_KEY` — API key for Chicago Cityscape Zoning Explorer (required for `fetch_ward_zoning_data` script)
- `VITE_API_URL` — (Frontend) Override API base URL; without this, falls back to a hardcoded Railway production URL (see `src/services/api.ts`)
- `VITE_APPLICATION_NAME` — (Frontend) App display name (default: `Open Advocacy`)
- `VITE_APPLICATION_DESCRIPTION` — (Frontend) App tagline

## After Making Changes

Always run these checks before considering work complete. All must pass with zero errors.

### Backend (from `backend/`)

```bash
poetry run ruff check .                   # Lint — no warnings allowed
poetry run ruff format --check .          # Format — reformat if needed with `ruff format .`
poetry run mypy .                         # Type check — no `# type: ignore` comments
poetry run pytest                         # Unit tests — all must pass
```

### Frontend (from `frontend/`)

```bash
npm run lint                              # ESLint — no warnings allowed
npm run type-check                        # TypeScript strict mode — no `@ts-ignore`
npm test                                  # Unit tests — all must pass
npm run test:e2e                          # Playwright E2E tests — all must pass or be expected skips
```

> **Note:** `npm test` runs unit tests only (Vitest). It does NOT run Playwright E2E tests. E2E tests must be run separately with `npm run test:e2e` and require the full stack (`docker-compose up`).

Run backend and frontend checks independently. Fix any failures before moving on. Do not suppress errors with ignore comments — fix the actual types.

### E2E Test Notes

- Playwright tests require the full stack to be running (`docker-compose up`)
- Tests in `frontend/e2e/specs/` cover auth, projects, representatives, dashboard, editor workflow, and admin
- Auth-dependent tests (admin, editor workflow) are skipped when those users don't exist — this is expected and not a failure
- Geo tests (representative lookup) run by default via Nominatim; set `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_GEO_TESTS=true` to skip them
- If tests fail, run `npm run test:e2e:report` to open the HTML report with screenshots

### Frontend Component Guidelines

- **One component per file** — each React component lives in its own file named after the component (e.g. `ScoreCell.tsx`). Never define multiple exported or meaningful components in a single file. Small, purely internal render helpers (no props, no logic) are the only exception, and even those should be extracted if they grow.
- **Group related components in a folder** — when a page or feature needs several components, create a folder (e.g. `src/pages/Scorecard/`) with an `index.tsx` entry point and sibling files for each sub-component.
- **Co-locate tests** — unit test files (`*.test.tsx`) live next to the component file they test.
- **Export pure logic separately** — utility functions extracted from components should be exported so they can be unit-tested independently.

### Testing Guidelines

- No sleeps, waits, or fake timers in unit tests — keep tests fast and deterministic
- Focus on high-value tests that verify real business logic, not language behavior or mocks
- Avoid testing trivial code (simple getters, pass-throughs, `if x is None: raise`)

### Adding a New Import Location

1. Create `backend/app/imports/locations/<location>.py` with location config and import steps
2. Add data sources under `app/imports/sources/` if needed
3. Register in `app/imports/orchestrator.py`
4. Run `python -m scripts.import_data <location>`
